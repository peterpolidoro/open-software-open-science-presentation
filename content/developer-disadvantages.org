- No profit, good for avoiding enshittification, but difficult for developers
- Unpaid, but passionate volunteers, sometimes ungrateful users
- Burnout and stress, users expect unlimited development and support for free
- Projects may die from lack of support
- Companies use and profit on free work of others, often without contributing back
