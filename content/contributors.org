- FOSS needs network effect of users and contributors.
- Users can and should be contributors.
- Contributions may be:
  - code
  - documentation and translation
  - asking and answering questions of forums
  - sending developers useful suggestions
  - positive attitude for improving quality rather than denegrating shortcomings
  - financial donations
  - attending talks and conferences and learning about FOSS alternatives
  - giving talks, writing, making videos, spreading publicity about interesting
    projects
  - friendly collaborations with smart passionate people
  - being inclusive of other options and alternatives rather than demanding conformity
