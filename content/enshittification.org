Cory Doctorow 2022 blog post: "Social Quitting"

Pattern in which products and services decline in quality over time.

1. Companies offer high-quality products free or at a loss to attract users.
2. Degrade user offerings to benefit suppliers, advertisers, and business customers.
3. Degrade quality and support to save money and increase prices to maximize profit.
